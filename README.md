Snap Usage Monitor extension for Google Chrome

You can install this extension from the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snap-usage-monitor/okffoefibimfmcddjbmbfnlbjdpjokkn

The source code is here on GitHub for all to see, anyway.

If Snap is your ISP, this extension lets you view details of your data usage with the click of a button:
• Data used
• Data remaining
• Average daily usage
• Billing period estimate
• Suggested daily usage
• Time remaining
• Network status announcements

And a visual progress bar that displays:
• Percentage of data used towards your limit
• How far through the billing period you are

Requires Chrome version 26 or higher.
