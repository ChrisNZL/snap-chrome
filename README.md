If Snap is your ISP, this extension lets you view details of your data usage with the click of a button:
* Data used
* Data remaining
* Average daily usage
* Billing period estimate
* Suggested daily usage
* Time remaining
* Network status announcements

And a visual progress bar that displays:
* Percentage of data used towards your limit
* How far through the billing period you are

**Requires Google Chrome or Chromium version 26 or higher.**
